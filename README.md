# High_Efficient_solar_Car
1. My Solar Car uses solar panels, also known as photovoltaic cells, to convert sunlight directly into electricity, which is then used to power the vehicle's electric motor and other systems.

# Method
1.First I had Connected the motors with the motor driver.

2.Then, Installed the UNO chip and connected it with the motor driver.

3.Installed the Bluetooth module and connected it to the UNO chip.

4.Then, I fixed the Solar Panels at the top of the model.

5.Rest, Fixed some design looks to make it better looking, you can see in the file I attached.

# Future View point
1. These type of cars are designed to be environmentally friendly, as they produce zero tailpipe emissions and have the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint associated with transportation.
   
2.solar cars represent an exciting and promising concept for the future of sustainable transportation, and ongoing research and technological advancements are likely to lead to more practical and efficient solar-powered vehicles in the coming years.
